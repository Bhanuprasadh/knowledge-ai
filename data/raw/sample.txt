Python Programming Language
===========================

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

Key Features:
- Easy to learn and read
- Versatile: used for web development, data science, machine learning
- Large ecosystem of libraries


Machine Learning Basics
========================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - learns from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - learns through trial and error


Neural Networks
===============

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information.
